"""
Python is an interpreted language because the source code is converted into bytecode 
and then executed by the Python virtual machine, instead of being built and linked like other compiled languages: 
Python interpreter: A computer program that converts each line of high-level program code into machine code. 
Bytecode: A platform-independent file that allows Python programs to run on any system with a compatible interpreter. 
Python virtual machine: Executes the bytecode. 
Python is also a hybrid language because it uses both a compiler and an interpreter for translation. 
When Python code is run, it's first compiled and then interpreted line by line. 
The compiled part is deleted after the code is executed.
