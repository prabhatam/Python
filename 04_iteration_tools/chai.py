# step1: open this file in the integrated terminal
# step2: now lets explore the file related operations

# to open the file
# myfile = open('chai.py)


# to read the file
# myfile.readline() => this reads the file one line
# to read the complete file keep on writing this line againa again
# at the end you will receive empty string when no line is left

# background knowledge how file responds to looping
# myfile.__next__() => this reads the file one line
# to read the complete file keep on writing this line againa again
# at the end you will error to stop iteration when no line is left

# the above operation can be done using for loop also
# for line in open('chai.py'):
#   print(line,end='')
